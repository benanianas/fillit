# Fillit Project

Our program must take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible.
Our main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time,
despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.

* In this project i used some functions from my library "libft" and get\_next\_line function from a former project.
* For more informations you can find the project subject fillit.pdf .
